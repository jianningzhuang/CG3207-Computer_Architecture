	AREA    MYCODE, CODE, READONLY, ALIGN=9 ; 2^9 = 512 bytes (enough space for 128 words). Each section is aligned to an address divisible by 512.
   	  ENTRY
	  
; ------- <code memory (ROM mapped to Instruction Memory) begins>
; Total number of instructions should not exceed 127 (126 excluding the last line 'halt B halt').

		LDR R1, LEDS		; Read the location LEDs to get a pointer to (address of) the LEDs into R1. R1 content will be 0x00000C00 after this step is executed.
		LDR R2, DIPS		; Read the location DIPs to get a pointer to (address of) the DIPs into R2. R2 content will be 0x00000C04 after this step is executed.		

main_loop
		LDR R3, DELAY_VAL	; Read the location DELAY_VAL (tentatively, 4) to get the number of iterations in the delay loop into R3.
		LDR R4, [R2]		; Read the location pointed to by R2 (i.e., DIPs) and get the value into R4.
		STR R4, [R1]		; Write R4 content into the location pointed by R1 (i.e., LEDs). If you get an access violation notification, you haven't applied the MMIO.ini file.
		
delay_loop	
		SUBS R3, R3, #1		; Implement a delay loop. Run the loop by the number of iterations specified in R3. 
		BNE delay_loop		; A delay loop is the equivalent of for(i=0; i<R3; i++){}; - a loop which runs R3 times without doing anything.
		B main_loop		; Go back to line 18. Uncomment this line if you wish to go back and loop
							; which you might want to do when simulating reading DIPs and writing the value to LEDs continously

		; some random instructions below to illustrate the use of PC as an operand, loads, stores etc - doesn't do anything meaningful. Try them out nevertheless.
		MOV  R1, R15        ; It is interesting to note that R15 is read as PC+8 in ARM7. Here, R1 = PC+8 = 0x1C + 8 = 0x24. Does it make sense to have PC=0x1C? - yes, as this is the 7th instruction.
		LDR  R0, constant1	; 
		STR  R5, variable1  ; PC relative STRs are supported in ARM7 (ARMv3 ISA), unlike LPC1769/ARM Cortex M3 or STM32L4/ARM Cortex M4 (ARMv7M ISA)
		LDR  R5, variable1	; load from a variable only after storing something to it (variables are in RAM - a volatile memory)
		LDR	 R2, variable1_addr	; to get the address of variable1 in R2. 
		; instead of the pseudo-instruction LDR	 R2, =variable1, use LDR R2, variable1_addr	and variable1_addr DCD variable1
		STR  R0, [R2]		; store using address of variable 1 as a pointer. *R2 = R0;
		STR  R0, [R2,#4] 	; *(R2+4) = R0; this will cause an access violation as the simulator will see that there is no memory/variable allocated at 0x00000804. 
							; It will work fine on hardware (i.e., in a real system) though, just that you should be sure that the location that you are writing to is something that is ok to 
							; write to (i.e., there is a real writeable hardware/memory mapped to that location, and you are not accidentally overwriting something else, 
							; and some other part of the code wont accidentally overwrite this (the simulator checks this, real hardware will happily allow you to shoot yourself in the foot).
halt	
		B    halt           ; infinite loop to halt computation. // A program should not "terminate" without an operating system to return control to
							; keep halt	B halt as the last line of your code.

	AREA    CONSTANTS, DATA, READONLY, ALIGN=9 
; ------- <constant memory (ROM mapped to Data Memory) begins>
; All constants should be declared in this section. This section is read only (Only LDR, no STR).
; Total number of constants should not exceed 128 (124 excluding the 4 used for peripheral pointers).
; If a variable is accessed multiple times, it is better to store the address in a register and use it rather than load it repeatedly.
